# Chaos-control-and-schedule-of-shuttle-buses

This code simulate the dynamical behavior of a few shuttle buses when they pass each other freely and control the speed to retrieve the loading’s delay

## Overview

We study the dynamical behavior of a few shuttle buses when they pass each other freely and control the speed to
retrieve the loading’s delay. The dynamics of the buses is expressed in terms of the nonlinear maps. The tour times of buses and the time headway between buses exhibit the complex behavior with varying trips. The buses exhibit deterministic chaos even if there are no noises. Bus speeds up to retrieve the delay induced by loading the passengers on its bus. The bus chaos is controlled by varying the degree of speedup. The chaotic motion depends on both loading and speedup’s parameters. The shuttle bus schedule is connected with the complex motions of shuttle buses. The region map (phase diagram) is shown to control the complex motions of buses.
